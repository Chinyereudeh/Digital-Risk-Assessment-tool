The Digital Risk Assessment Tool is designed to evaluate digital vulnerabilities across three critical dimensions:

system Security Features such as authentication, encryption, and access control  
Data Sensitivity including personal, financial, and health-related information  
Ethical Concerns like algorithmic bias, surveillance, and lack of transparency  

The tool calculates a risk score and flags ethical issues to promote responsible technology use.

Technologies Used
HTML for structural layout  
CSS for styling and visual clarity  
JavaScript for logic, interactivity, and dynamic risk scoring  
Ethical Framework
This project integrates ethical principles into technical design by encouraging:

Fairness audits to detect bias  
Privacy safeguards to protect sensitive data  
Transparency in data handling and system behavior  

It serves as both a practical utility and a guide for ethical digital development.

Creating this tool allowed me to:
- Apply web development skills in a meaningful, real-world context  
- Explore the intersection of technology and ethics  
- Lay the foundation for my interest in data science, cybersecurity, and digital governance  
This project represents my belief that technology should empower, not exploit
